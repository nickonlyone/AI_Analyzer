Call to Action

Key Words: 

Activation1) NFP (NonFarm Payroll) An unemployment report in the US. It announces how many working places the companies opened or how many people lost their jobs in America. It comes out 1st Friday of the Month. NFP is meant to pay a negative or positive impact on the USD ratio (Forex), on Gold. (it's a market rule that one of these two ( Gold or USD) falls or rises. If Gold falls – the Usd rises and otherwise.)

2) Senior Financial Advisor– a professional trading expert with extended experience, with 89% success rate in trading with the 3A level accreditation whose job is to assist the client, educate, explain, support, and guide him through the process using the strong Risk management tools. He/she using Fundamental analysis, builds the investment plan individually and get his commission from the client's profit.

3) Risk Management - set of measures meant to secure the invested funds, reduce the risk and maximize the profit - is Stop Loss/ Take Profit and Diversification.
StopLoss / TakeProfit levels
SL – A price point lower which the price won't go and the deal will be automatically closed to avoid loss of invested amount
TP - A price point higher which the price won't go and guarantees to take the gained profit in time

4) Diversification – free trading amount is never invested into one trade only to avoid the risk of loss. Allowed to take 10-20% from deposit into 1 trade and open multiple deals. Don't put all eggs in one basket.

5) Spread Is a small brokerage commission for each deal opened.
Brokerage commission normally is calculated from the profit SFA made for a client in a range of 0,5-10% depending on many factors and is deducted automatically from the trades

6) CFD (Contract For Difference)
Is a method of short time trading with the assets prices without owning the asset physically "Difference" means here the change between the opening price and closing price. No matter how the price moves (Up Trend or Down Trend) the price falling or rising – the traders are making money by the price direction The only thing that matters in CFD trading – to predict the right trend direction which is done by your SFA (ex. You believe that the price of an asset will fall by 10% by the end of the day and it actually happened – you are gaining this 10 %. If the price has moved the opposite direction (went up) you are losing 10 %. And otherwise.)

Theory of Black Swan:

Do you know the theory of Black Swan? It's so-called unpredictable factors that you can either benefit from or fail.
Who you are and where you are at the moment - is a series of decisions you have made over your lifetime.
Imagine you are a turkey on a farm. Your owner is feeding and taking care of you for a long time, while you grow and gain weight. Would you ever suspect him in a dirty plan to harm or kill you? No!

But on a Thanksgiving day, you are killed and cooked.... What is the lesson? Your experience is not a subject of statistics.

The human brain relies on a determination, that crashes the system. Never stake on a horse that comes always first, as with time it gets older and can even not rise up on a starting line due to the severe treatment. Risks are waiting for you everywhere. Our problem is that we don't want to acknowledge the lack of information. It's a comfort zone. The one who confesses he is a fool - will win rather than the one who thinks he knows all. What is going on atm in the world was, is, and will always be a subject of analysis and forecast by the particular bodies. But it doesn't mean that their prediction is meant to secure you but to determine their future actions.
